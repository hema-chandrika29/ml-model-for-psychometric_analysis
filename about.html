Its scalable design allows it to adapt to various roles, serving the organization's specific requirements, thus optimizing the hiring process by efficiently aligning candidates with job positions. This comprehensive approach enhances the candidate-organization fit and ensures more successful, sustainable hires while also increasing operational efficiency.</p>
